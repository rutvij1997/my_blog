## Introduction

Requirements engineering is a crucial aspect of the software development process, as it lays
the foundation for subsequent stages, such as implementation and testing of a software
system. However, eliciting and retrieving requirements from natural language documents
remains a challenging and time-consuming process that often requires a significant amount
of manual work. To address this problem, natural language processing (NLP) methods
and tools have been developed to help extract requirements concepts and automate the
process of requirements extraction.
This work aims to provide a systematic literature review of the current state of the art in
requirements extraction using NLP. The primary focus will be on identifying publications
with well-justified and documented NLP approaches for requirements extraction. To
achieve this goal, a search strategy and selection of relevant studies based on inclusion and
exclusion criteria will be defined. A mapping study will be conducted with a quantitative
analysis covering the following aspects:

• Year-wise distribution of publications

• Algorithms and models

• NLP technologies and methodologies

• Used NLP libraries and programming languages

• Countries of the authors who contributed to the publications.
