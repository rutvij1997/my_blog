## Approach 1: Basic Text Extraction

• “Copy-Paste” approach

• Python libraries for text extraction: PyPDF2, PDFMiner, PyMuPDF

• Define rules using RegEx

## Drawbacks:

• Definition of pattern rules is inconsistent, i.e., they work in some cases, in others not(too few     information about text given)

• No paragraphs and indentation detectable, i.e., the (begin and) end of the requirement text cannot be  detected

• Additional information (hyperlinks, highlighting, bold font style, etc.) are lost

• The order of entries do not necessarily match with the visible order in the document

## Approach 2: Image Recognition

• Conversion to graphic format

• Detection of paragraphs (boxes) using OpenCV

• Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Python-tesseract 

## Drawbacks:

• Conversion to JPG very inefficient (takes a long time)

• OCR detection is very inefficient and not fully accurate (and actually unnecessary when text was readable)

• Detection of boxes with OpenCV works but is also very inefficient (many boxes per page)

## Approach 3: Advanced Text Extraction

• Advanced (but free) Python libraries: PyMuPDF (best in our comparison)

• Many additional text information: boxes, coordinates, font name, size, style, etc.

## Created a rule-based algorithm:

• Exclude text on margins (heading, footnotes, page numbers, imprint)

• Order sorted by vertical appearance on the page

• Rules (patterns) for each information, e.g.

Requirement: Font size = 12, Font = Arial Normal, Text starts with “[G2L”
Section: Font size = 13, 14, 16, Font = Arial Bold, Text starts with number
Requirement_append: Font size = 12, Font = Arial Normal, Indentation > 120, predecessor = requirement
