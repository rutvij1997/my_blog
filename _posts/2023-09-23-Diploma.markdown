This project focuses on the utilization of wind energy as a renewable
source. In the United States alone, wind capacity has grown about 45% to
16.7GW and it continues to grow with the facilitation of new wind projects .
The aim of this major qualifying project is to design and Implement a
magnetically levitated vertical axis wind turbine system that has the ability
to operate in both high and low wind speed conditions. Our choice for this
model is to showcase its efficiency in varying wind conditions as
compared to the traditional horizontal axis wind turbine and contribute
to its steady growing popularity for the purpose of mass utilization in the
near future as are liable source of power generation. Unlike the traditional
horizontal axis wind turbine, this design is levitated via maglev
(magnetic levitation) vertically on a rotor shaft. This maglev
technology, which will be looked at in great detail, serves as an
efficient replacement for ball bearings used on the conventional wind
turbine and is usually implemented with permanent magnets.
